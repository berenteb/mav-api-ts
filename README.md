# MÁV API TypeScript library (beta)
Unofficial, experimental MÁV API library based on the requests by https://jegy.mav.hu.
This is experimental and strongly unofficial, do not use commercially - just experiment with it!

## About types
There are types based on the requests the site sent and responses the site got.
Some fields have typo in their names - this is intentional from the creators of this package, since the API gives these fields.

## About requests
Requests are made with Axios and they kind of cover the full set of requests made by the site.
